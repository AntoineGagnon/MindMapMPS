# MindMapMPS
This language can be used with [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) to create .mindmap files with a simple syntax accessible to anyone.
These mindmap files can then be converted to LaTeX via MPS to create structured files according to the different topics in the file.

You can find the tutorial that led to the creation of this language [here](https://dev.to/antoine/creating-a-simple-language-using-jetbrains-mps-c7d)

This language was created as part of a model driven engineering course that also led to the writing of an article that can be found [here](http://antoinegagnon.fr/MPS-article-Gagnon.pdf)
